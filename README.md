# My Cookbook to store the endless recepies i hold scattered around my kitchen!

### Base Idea of this app is to be able to seperate recipes by breakfast, lunch and dinner into categoreis. then further seperation by meal types. Such as Mexican, Chineese, American... etc.

### core programming ideas for website:

#### 1. Form to create new recipies to be added into specific categories

#### 2. Individual pages for each recipe providing images and detailed instructions, calorie count, and subsitutes for creating a recipe.

#### 3. Breaking down each item into categories for easier search and filter.

#### 4. Most important none of that life story attached to the recipe that so many recipe websites love to share! Just 👏 the 👏 recipe 👏 PLEASE!

## Progress and Fixes

### 1. Finish adding logic to Lunch, Dinner, and Desserts for adding recipes to local storage.

### 2. Make final adjustments on Scss

### 3. Fix issues with recipes not saving to local storgae.
